# LRGS - Lightweight Responsive Grid System

A normal css grid system for basic projects. The reason I'm creating this is because I like to have full control of my own code. I will also just add the bare essentials to make this grid work properly, no bloat that slows it down.

##TODO:
1. Get a basic grid layout working.  
  1.1. Twelve column.  
  2.2. Support column push.  
  2.3. ???  
  2.4. Profit.  
2. Make it responsive.
